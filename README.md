# surfs_up
## **Overview of Project**

The purpose of this project is to W. examine the information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, we want to show a major investor specific information about temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
The project utilizes SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database and it uses statistics like minimum, maximum, and average to analyze the data.

## Results

 ### June Temperatures 
In June we recorded 1700 measurements, with a mean of 74.9, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0

## Summary

 - The needs of each department in the Silver Tsunami is different. Some departments will be hit hard whilew others will see very small effect. Mentorship resources should therefore be prioritized and allocated accordingly
 - The company is certainly going to be hurt badly if it does not plan early for this problem. The number of soon to be retired employees and hence the number ofg jobs that will need to be filled is orders of magnitues larger than the number of mentors and qualified replacement staff.
